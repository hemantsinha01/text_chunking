Meanwhile, Alexis was busy writing, with her papers scattered all around and Yuki, her white pelt stained with blood and ink, on her lap gently purring. She couldn\'t have been in a better mood, yet her green eyes and young face still looked troubled, and this time it wasn\'t because of the noise from outside. Throwing down her pen, she pushed her hands through her short dark brown hair and gave a sigh. It had been hard these past days. Having so many questions with no one to answer her, the only comfort being Yuki and these words on paper. She had forgotten how hard it was to be alone for so long. She always hated it when people checked up on her, but somehow she knew it only meant that they cared. But there were so few to care for her now. Giving herself a shake she grabbed her pen and started to write again.\n"May, Friday the 13th."\n"How ironic," she muttered to herself.\n"Year? I have no idea right now, or in fact, ever. The DustAngels came by as usual this morning in the street announcing it to be the year 2065. But somehow I doubt it. It couldn\'t possibly have already been 52 years since the war. Mom was only 18 when it broke out, and she disappeared last year, January, on her 43rd birthday. I can\'t remember that much about her, but I do remember her smile, her laugh and her eyes, they were the most beautiful blue/green colour. But that\'s all. Anyway, back to the DustAngels. I mean, sure, we all follow them and their rules. And we do depend on them for food and water, but everyone knows that trusting them with information is a mistake, or rather, a risk. Mom told me that the only ones we must truly trust and depend on are the Guardian Rebels. They were said to be the ones who wanted to prevent the war, who only wanted to bring peace, equality and protection. But the DustAngels turned us against them with lies of weapons, destruction and betrayal. So another war broke out, only this time, the one side won and the other side was completely de-"\nA harsh cold voice cut through her thoughts and writing.\n"Alexis, what the hell are you doing?"\nWith a sharp jerk of her head she looked up to find her father, with a scowl on his face and his rifle slung across his back. He didn\'t seem to have shaved at all since he had left two weeks ago, but he still stood proud with his shoulders squared and his tall frame leaning against the open door.\n"Nothing much," she mumbled, and with a quick flash of her hands she quickly stuffed her papers into her backpack and jumped to her feet. Yuki, '), (4, 3864, 'surprised by the sudden movement, gave a short meow of protest and then settled near her feet.\n"We have a new target today, we leave in 5, so get your stuff and let\'s go!" "Already? But I terminated three targets on Tuesday! Shouldn\'t I lay low for a while longer?"\n"Did I ask for your opinion?" his father growled. "No? Then shut up and get ready."\nAs he walked out of the door he paused and looked back at Alexis.\n"You know, asking too many questions and always writing crap won\'t save your life. So do something productive for a change."\nAnd with that he walked out of the room and could be heard stomping downstairs.\nAlexis gave a sigh and set off towards the cupboard in the corner for her equipment. She took her McMillan Tac-50, nicknamed \'Shi\', which meant \'Death\' in Japanese, and swapped her backpack for the one which had all the necessary equipment. Then, with Yuki settled on her shoulders, she set off towards the door. But just as she wanted to close the door, she realized she had forgotten something. Dumping her bag, she hurried inside and grabbed the necklace her mother had given to her on her sixteenth birthday, a good luck charm, a strange flower which had only four green petals. It was the only thing she had left of her.\nThey traveled fast and silent. The moon was shining like a silver sun and a cool breeze would rustle the few leaves or paper that were lying about. Alexis snuck through buildings and streets like a shadow, her father keeping behind to make sure they weren\'t being followed. Every now and then they would ask around, or track their target. Alexis was used to this, following leads, silencing those wanted to know why or who they were. Often they would find a lead which ended up being the wrong person; they only found this after killing.\nIt was around 2 am when the fifth bullet struck home. A few seconds later the body tumbled off the roof and landed with a thwack on the ground. Alexis nodded her head and spoke into the mic.\n\'Got her, body is on the north side of the building, estimate 5 meters from the road."\nThere was a crackle of static and the reply came.\n"I saw, thanks to the moon that is. Go check if she\'s the one and report back."\n"Got it, I\'m on my way."\nAlexis slung her rifle onto her back and hopped down the stairs, Yuki once again settled on her shoulders. She checked to see if all was clear and quickly ran across the road. Safe! She never quite did feel comfortable when the moon was out like this, she felt too open and exposed. And then there was the task of checking the bodies which she didn\'t exactly feel comfortable with either. Especially when they turned out to be the wrong ones. But she still nudged '), (5, 6546, 'the body with her boot and turned it on its back. A shot sounded off inside the building opposite her and she dove to the ground, cursing.\n"The hell was that !? " she almost shrieked into the mic.\n"Nothing, just a pest, it\'s all taken care of."\n"I hope so," Alexis mumbled to herself.\nShe shook her head and got up from the ground, checking that Yuki and Shi were okay. She glanced at the body and frowned. She shook her head again and took out the papers from her bag, which stated the target and their mission.\n"Target is female, dark brown hair, blue/green eyes. She was seen communicating with the Guardian rebels. Mission is to eliminate her and track down any relatives who might be in connection, guilty or not. No given name/s".\nAlexis shrugged and got on with business. She dragged the body out into the street where she could see better and examined it properly.\n"Yep, she\'s the right one this time, I think. Nasty fall though and it\'s hard to see much of her face. Can\'t I just use a flashlight? The moonlight is a nice effect but seeing if she\'s really the one is pretty hard."\n"No, flashlight might catch unwanted attention. Just get her ID and a few photos of her face, we need proof."\n"Okay, whatever then. I got the ID, definitely her, strange name though. Teresa Griffin."\nThere was no reply, only static. Alexis frowned and then gave a shudder, the strangest feeling of fear in the pit of her stomach.\n"Father? What is my last name?"\nBut even as the words left her lips Alexis already knew the answer.\nAnd with the answer came a sudden sharp pain and then blissful darkness. '), (6, 8139, 'The Three Little Men by Andrew Kim\nThe bell startled me as I was thinking about what kind of delivery my sister had sent me. I rushed to the door with a smile on my face, as I was opening the door, I was expecting too see Mr Daniels, my mailman for the past 3 years throughout my stay in Seattle.\n"Mr Daniels! You\'ve kept me waiting!"\n"Umm, I\'m afraid Mr Daniels won\'t be coming anymore."\nA middle aged man, about 5 foot high, was taking my package out of his oversized bag.\n"James Todd?"\n"Yea, that\'s me." "Here is your package, James."\nI saw the name on his name tag and tried to get rid of the awkwardness that was flowing between Mr Reephur and I through the open door. "So are you new? What happened to Mr Daniels?"\nI handed the signed receipt back to him as he hurriedly closed his bag. He snatched the receipt out of my hand and stuffed it into his pocket. All I could see was the train of his navy green coat swinging around the corner of the corridor before I could thank him. I set the package on the kitchen table and went to search for a knife.\nAs I was opening the delivery, a sudden gush of disappointment went through my body as I realized that my sister had sent me the exact same tea package that she had sent me last year for my birthday.\n"Need a cane? Jack?" I examined the extraordinary way the way Jack was limping to get more packages to deliver. He had no reaction, as I took the last long drag before lunch break was over, I thought of something that could teach Jack Reephur, the new delivery guy, a lesson.\n"Hey Reephur!, I\'m talking to you!" I raised my voice; he stopped and turned his head in my direction slowly. His stare at me made me speechless; it was not fear I saw in his eyes, it was anger. As I was left dumbfounded, I saw him walking back to the truck with a bag loaded with packages.\nAs the roaring of the delivery truck descended, my co-worker asked me "What was that all about Tony? Got scared?" This must\'ve been funny for them since Reephur was not staring at them. I could not forget the stare he was giving me.\nThis was no more a joke when the time passed 13:45. The company had promised that the package would be delivered by 13:30. As I was walking out of my office, I noticed a delivery man coming out of the elevator. '), (7, 10407, '"Delivery for Mr Richard Bronwen!"\nI heard his weak trembling voice as he was trying to make an attempt to find out who I was. The accountant near the elevator pointed at my office which guided him and his weird steps to my desk.\n"Mr ... Richard ... Bron ... Bronwen?"\n"Yes, that is me, and I must state that you are 15 minutes late." His discrete mumbling made it practically impossible to hear on this huge floor with constant phones ringing. This man was staring at the ground the whole time and couldn\'t lift his head up. I was suspecting that it was because of his guilty conscience at being late. But, as I was planning to forgive him after I finished signing, he quickly snatched it out of my hand and left the office.\nThe bell woke me up. It was just past 11PM. As I was wondering about who it could be, the bell rang again.\n"Who is it?"\n"Its an emergency delivery from Israel."\n\'Israel? Who could it be from Israel?\' I thought to myself. I put the safety chain on the door and peaked through the gap. There was an intense moment of silence as I stay quiet watching Mr Reephur take the package out of his bag. I closed my door to open up and receive the package. Before I could realize what had happened I felt a sting on my neck and everything blacked out.\nI was on duty that night filling in for the security guard. The time was almost midnight. It was not hard to notice that the short man in the pixelized monitor of the surveillance camera was Jack. He was standing with his head down: it seemed like he was waiting for something. But as I squinted my eyes to catch the most out of the small man in the monitor, I was in great shock. It looked like he was laughing at something.\nHe was slowly turning his head towards the surveillance camera, and when he looked into the camera, I ran to the door and locked it as fast as possible. When I came back to my seat to check where he was, the man was gone.\nThe continuous fear that was flowing through my guts while trying to spot the man in the monitors made me sick. I could feel cold sweat running down my back, I looked at every floor and every corridor, there was no sign of him.\nI stayed alert for about 20 minutes with my eyes wide open, staring into 6 different monitors hoping to find the man who had just stared at me through the surveillance camera.\nAs I was slowly getting relieved by the fact that I was the only person in this building, the stress pulled me back towards the chair.\n"Hi, Tony"\nI heard Jack\'s voice right behind me as I was comforting myself on the chair.\n"Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony" '), (8, 12986, 'As I opened my eyes, I felt a gush of pain in my head. As I was moaning to search for balance. I realized that I was tied onto a bed. The tight restriction of my hands and feet alarmed my instincts and I was trying to figure out where I was.\n"Tony, Tony, Tony ... Why did you leave me"\n"Jack? Jack Reephur?"\n"That ... is correct." His voice did not sound like anything at work, I could hear a strain of joy in his voice.\n"What is this Jack? Where am I?"\n"Tony ... Tony ... We had such good times together ... "\n"Jack, talk to me, where am I? Was it you at the parking lot?" "Tony ... Why did you leave me ... "\n"Jack what are you talking about? We only met each other 2 weeks ... "\nBefore I even finished that sentence, a peak of pain went through my throat and it was impossible for me to talk. I could feel the warm liquid pumping out of the slit in my neck every time I tried to breathe.\nAs my vision blurred, I saw Jack, looking at me with empathy filled in his eyes.\n"H ... he .. l ... p"\n"Be quiet Tony, you\'re going to wake our baby"\n"You ... crazy ... son .. of ... a ... "\n"Ugh ...... " the light was too bright for me to open my eyes. I turned my head sideways and squinted my eyes. I saw a man with the navy green coat. "Mr ... Reephurs?"\n"Hold on James, I have to clean up the pieces that flew out of Tony\'s head when I combed his hair."\nI saw red liquid and small pink colored chunks. I threw up on my side when I spotted a deformed eyeball on the floor.\n"Oh boy ... seems like I have more work to do, hold on James, I\'m going to get some more plastic bags."\nI pretended to faint, I did not know what do to. Every sound of his footsteps leaving the room made me shiver.\nI walked faster and faster, trying to avoid the man who was following me in the parking lot. There were 7 more pillars to pass until I reached my car. "Mr ... Mr Bronwen?"\nIt was a familiar voice, after stopping my footsteps I thought about who it could be.\n"I\'m ... the ... m ... mailman ... "\nI then remembered his face: the slow mailman with the limp.\n"Oh, hello, Mr ... "\n"Jack, my name is Jack"\n"Hello Mr Jack. Do you need something?" '), (9, 15109, 'He approached me slowly, so slow that I did not notice until he was about 10 inches away from me. I spotted a hammer in his hand, I turned around and started walking again, my fastest this time.\n"Mr ... Bronwen!" My steps were faster and faster. I could hear multiple steps that were close behind me.\n\'2 more pillars left ... E6 ... E5 ... \' I saw my car, took the keys out of my pocket. I turned around to check if that maniac was near me. As I turned around to my car to open the door with shaking hands, I saw the mailman, with the hammer, behind me, with a grin, in the reflection of the mirror.\nI grunted to take my hands out of the leather belt that was just about the size of my wrist. I made a last attempt to pull my hands out, but it did not work.\nI heard footsteps that were closing in to the door from the outside, my heartbeat was increasing rapidly and the intensity of the situation made me throw up again.\n"Police! Put your hands up!"\nI was saved, finally.\nAfter knowing that my new mailman was a crazy serial killer who killed guys who had names of his exboyfriends, I decided to start a new quiet life in Virginia.\nLife here has been amazing here, I found a nice job, have a nice girlfriend.\nIt was my birthday, when I came home from dinner with my girlfriend, I noticed that I had a package delivered to me. I expected it to be my sister.\nAs I was reading through the paper attached to the package, I saw "Delivery by: Jack Reephur." '), (10, 16562, 'The Examination Day by Julia Bauerschmidt\nIt wasn\'t unusual for her not to go her family\'s birthdays. She was always too busy with work and therefore just called her nephew and congratulated him on his twelfth birthday, but they quickly had to leave, because he had to go to some kind of appointment. It also wasn\'t unusual that they didn\'t tell her to what kind of appointment they were going, because she never spoke of her work or her life either. Apparently it had to be kept a secret. After a few minutes she realized that she was late for work and quickly rushed out.\n"You\'re late. Go behind the mirror and get ready to ask the questions. The boy will be here soon," her boss said harshly.\nShe did as he said and sat down behind a mirror where she could look into the room, but nobody could see her. It was a very plain room. There was no color on the wall, no pictures hung on the walls and there were no windows. It was a very depressing room, but she\'d gotten used to it. While she was getting ready for the what they called the \'exam\' the boy was probably already being given the drink that would make him tell the truth. It was scary what they did here, but she was paid well and she\'d learned not to get emotional.\nThe door opened and she said: "Sit down, please!" to the young boy while she was still fiddling with some stuff with her back towards the mirror. As she turned around the pencil fell out of her hand and dropped on the floor, her jaw dropped and she just stared at the boy. She looked at him as if she had just seen a ghost.\n"Ehm, just ... ehm .. "\nShe didn\'t know what to say and in that moment another voice said, "Is your name Richard Jordan?"\n"Yes sir." the boy answered.\n"Your classification number is 600-115. Just answer these questions, please," the boss said. He gave her a very suspicious look and left the room.\nShe started the recording; the boy answered all the questions and all she had to do was record the answers.\nAfter he was done he just said there and waited while she gasped at the score. Her boss once again came into the room to collect the results. He looked at them and said, "I will have him escorted now. Inform the parents that his intelligence quotient has exceeded the Government regulation, according to, oh, you know the drill," and once again he left the room.\nShe walked out of the room as if she was paralyzed. She only looked forwards towards the phone. With a shaky hand she slowly dialed the family\'s number. After a few seconds a friendly and relieved sounding man picked up the phone.\n"Hey, sister ....
