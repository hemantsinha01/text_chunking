INTRODUCTION
============

This document is designed to test the text splitting and chunking capabilities of your system.

OVERVIEW
--------

We include multiple paragraphs, code snippets, and lists to mimic real-world documents.

Here is a Python function example:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)

Use this to calculate factorial numbers.

- First point
- Second point with emphasis on bold text
- Third point with an example link: https://example.com

End of page one.

JAVASCRIPT SECTION
==================

Now some JavaScript code for string manipulation:

function reverseString(str) {
    return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}

console.log(reverseString("Hello World!"));

DETAILS
-------

The above function reverses any string you pass to it. This section also contains some bullet points:

1. Point one
2. Point two
3. Point three

Testing sentence overlaps and paragraph boundaries is critical.

End of page two.

FINAL NOTES
===========

In conclusion, this document serves as a comprehensive example to evaluate chunking strategies.

SUMMARY
-------

We covered Python, JavaScript, headers, lists, and paragraphs. The idea is to simulate varied content.

Additional points:

* Chunk size management
* Handling nested structures
* Overlapping sentences between chunks

Thank you for testing this with your system!
